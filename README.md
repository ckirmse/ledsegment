# LED Segment controller

This module provides high-level control of 15-segment LED displays composed of
ws2812 pixels. Low-level control is handled by https://github.com/beyondscreen/node-rpi-ws281x-native .
That library is only designed for the Raspberry Pi, but without much effort this whole
system could be adapted to different displays and different controllers.

This library is for node.js apps.

The hardware was created by the Unexpected Maker https://unexpectedmaker.com/ https://www.tindie.com/products/seonr/laser-segment-display/
